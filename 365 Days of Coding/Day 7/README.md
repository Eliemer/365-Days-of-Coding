# Problem Statement
### Difficulty: `Medium`

Given the mapping `a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26`, and an
encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
Assume messages are decodable. For example `001` is not allowed

# Example
The message `111` would give 3, since it can be decoded as
`aaa` `ka` `ak`.
