# Problem Statement
### Difficulty: `Hard`
Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum
of __non-adjecent__ numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

### Extra Credit:
Can you do this in `O(n)` Time and `O(1)` Space?

# Example
Given `[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]`, the function should return `13` since we pick `[2, 6, 5]`.
`[5, 1, 1, 5]` should return `10` since we pick `[5, 5]`.
